# Loki

The Loki is as simple as it is salty.  It's got all the good parts of a gin martini, and none of the vermouth.  

### Ingredients

* 3 Pimento-stuffed olives
* Liberal dash of olive juice
* Gin
* Crushed Ice
* Dill Pickle

### Preparation

Fill an 8-oz tumbler glass with crushed ice to the brim.  

Pour olive juice till it looks 1/4 to 1/3rd full.  You'll notice that since the glass is filled with crushed ice, it gets full very quickly despite your not having added all that much olive juice -- be careful not to use too much or too little, it's quite important to making good Lokis.  Fill the rest of the glass with Gin and stir it with a dill pickle.
