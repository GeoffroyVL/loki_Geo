# reformed Loki (limey)

After a great deal of experimentation toiling in the Loki laboratory, I have learned that a Loki does have an ideal form, and this can be referred to as either the reformed Loki or the limey Loki.


* 10 oz glass
* Fill the glass entirely with ice
* Add the Juice of one half lime, and a small amount of olive brine
* Gin, with a preference of Monkey 47 or Tanqueray original, should be added until the glass is full
* serve the Loki with three olives and a pickle
